         <a name="gaming">Gaming</a>
         for me is a way to combat stress mainly from school and others. It is a way to escape from reality. Some would say that nothing comes good when playing computer games. Others would say that computer games can cause violence to the ones playing it. I say, that everything that is too much is bad. So when I say that I play computer games, I play it on a minimun level. I don't immerse myself in games all day. In short, I only play when I am at the right place and at the right time. When I was 4 years old, i know how to play Diablo, Virtua Cop, House of the Dead 2. After a year, I played on Counter Strike which is very famous then. Then for 2 years later, I learned of Star craft and Red Alert 2. Back on my highscool days, The Frozen Throne's customized map game DotA or Defense of the Ancients was so popular. I have also played my first 3 games on our first laptop which are Left 4 Dead, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and GTA: San Andreas. After awhile I quit gaming and moved on with my life till my 2nd year on college where I encountered DMC - Devil May Cry game which was the 5th insallment of the Devil May Cry PC games series. I coudn't believe my eyes as the graphics were so surreal  compared to the DMC 3, and 4 that I have played before. I bought It at a store here in Davao and played it. Till then I have 46 PC games that I have bought and played all of it.<br><br>

         is food for the soul. Music is what a crown to it's king. What would our world be without music? What a lonely world would it be right? This is one of my hobbies. Listening to good ol' music. Whenever I go out, I always want to hear some music with my earphones and my same old playlist. I'm accustomed to it. Without my earphones, I usually think I'm naked. As a child I grew up listening to late 80's songs up to late 90s songs. Bands like Nirvana, Weezer, Pixies, Dishwalla, Creed, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, The Ramones, Goldfinger, Blur, Coldplay and so much more is what formed my taste of music. I could go on and on on the bands that I know of and would glady share it with you. With this, I'm inspired to teach myself how to play guitars. I was on my 3rd year in highschool when I teach myself how to play. My parents bought me a guitar, my one and only and is still present till now. I tought myself thru OPM song book that has songs in it with chord chart. The first song that I played on guitar was "Otherside" by The Red Hot Chilli Peppers.

         <a name="shows">TV</a>
        shows and Movies has been a part of our lives since 1930s and 1878 respectively. This part of the entertainment industry is one of the biggest and is very influential to all of us and it is also one of my favorite hobbies. Watching tv shows or movies always is a good thing for me especially when I just want to relax and get the stress out. Although, what I would always watch on TV shows and movies were those of the DC and Marvel properties. I'm a huge fan of DC and Marvel and thus influenced me on my take on tv shows and movies. I don't watch any other tv shows unless they are of Marvel and DC. When it comes to movies though, I would watch it as long as it is interesting and its a sci-fi kind of film. Though even I like DC and Marvel properties, I am aware of the bad movies and shows that DC and Marvel offered to it's fans. <br><br>To better understand those tv shows and movies that I like and is interested,<a href="file:///C:/Users/ACER/projects/Forro_PersonalWebsite/shows.html" style="background-color: azure">heres</a> a list. I'll not include those TV shows and Movies that I don't like.
