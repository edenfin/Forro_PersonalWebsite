              I am Denniel Forro. I was born on September 4, 1995. My parents and I lived in Calinan, Davao City and I was born here on Davao. I am the only son of Nilo Forro, my father, and Elizabeth Forro, my mother. Even though I'm their only child, I wasn't spoiled by my parents as contrary to what other people would think of a only child. As a child I used to play computer games as a part time hobby and the other is by playing outside and enjoying my neighbor's company. I am a cheerful lad that is easy to be friend with. When i was 6 years old, I was influenced greatly by my uncle's song choices. When i was on grade 1, and I'm 6 years old, my favorite songs were on the late 80's and mid 90s. I grew up to be an audiophile on OPM songs and songs abroad. As I was on my highschool days I am one those guys that is innocent enough not to dissapoint my teachers and making sure not to cut classes. I found my first love on highschool but it didn't really ended well. As for my studies, I was on the average level but I'm trying to furnish myself further. As a grown up teenager that is fond of music, my favorite band was The Red Hot Chili Peppers. I admire their great songs and amazing guitar riffs and solos. I used to have a band then and we performed on school events and occasions. When I graduated highschool, I chose to go to the University of Southeastern Philippines to study. I chose BS in Mechanical Engineering as my course. 
              My collage life is not easy but I still find myself enjoying it. When I was on my first year days, I auditioned to the University Band. Weeks after I quit because I can't find time to cope up with engineering's pressure. Vacant hours of time proved to be useful for I will go to an internet shop to play games, with or without friends. Years have past and I was on my 4th year in engineering when I realized that my first choice BS in Information Technology is what I want for my profession. I shifted courses and I'm currently a IT student thriving to reach my goal for the betterment of my future.
